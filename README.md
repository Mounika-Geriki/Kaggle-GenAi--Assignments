Prompt engineering best practices
LLM evaluation methodologies

# Day 2: Embeddings and Vector Stores/Databases

Conceptual understanding of embeddings
Vector search algorithms
Implementation of RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
Text similarity analysis using embeddings
Neural classification with embedding techniques

# Day 3: Generative AI Agents

Core components of AI agents
Multi-agent system architectures
Function calling implementation
LangGraph for building agentic systems
Real-world agent evaluation methods

# Day 4: Domain-Specific LLMs

Specialized LLMs (SecLM, MedLM/Med-PaLM)
Fine-tuning Gemini models for custom tasks
Integrating Google Search data in generation
Domain adaptation techniques

# Day 5: MLOps for Generative AI

Adapting MLOps practices for GenAI
Vertex AI tools for foundation models
AgentOps for agentic applications
